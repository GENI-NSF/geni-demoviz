Design to keep data tables trimmed (only last 24 hours).

Here are the tables with user data and number of lines as of 3-17-2015:

bvermeulen_sdx
msb_metrics
nmetrics_cpu
nmetrics_memory
nmetrics_network
nriganikytopo2
starlight_metrics

select count(*) from bvermeulen_sdx; => 0
select count(*) from msb_metrics; => 209
select count(*) from nmetrics_cpu; => 3557396
select count(*) from nmetrics_memory; => 201564
select count(*) from nmetrics_network; => 3671062
select count(*) from nriganikytopo2; => 88596
select count(*) from starlight_metrics; => 0

We want to create a table that holds timestamps and max id's per tablename
create table table_history (
    timestamp integer,
    max_id    integer,
    tablename varchar
);

We want to do this every N minutes (say 60)
Begin transaction
For each table TBL in a list
1. Create an empty clone of TBL if doesn't exist (TBL_COPY)
2. Insert a record into table history
     insert into table_history (timestamp, max_id, tablename) values
         (now, (select max(id) from TBL), TBL);
3. Copy all rows from TBL to TBL where id < (select max(max_id) from table_history
          where timestamp < now - 86400)
4. Delete all rows from tbl where id < (select (max(max_id) from table_history where
          timestamp < now - 86400);
commit transaction
